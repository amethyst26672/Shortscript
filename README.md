# Shortscript
A tiny programming language created in python with the goal of simplicity.

Shortscript is a very small programming language i wrote in python with the goal of major simplicity, it does not contain the majority of programming structures you would expect (CURRENTLY) such as if statements or loops however, or any conditionals. Just a few functions it can run in order. However the language can be extended by functions programmed in python by adding them to the 'functions' folder. More info will be on the replit page for this project, that can be forked and used as a base for programming in the language
